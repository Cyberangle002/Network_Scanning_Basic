# üìù Detailed Report: Network Scanning & Vulnerability Assessment

---

## üîπ 1. Introduction
This project focuses on performing **network scanning and vulnerability assessment** on a deliberately vulnerable machine (**Metasploitable2**).  
The main objective was to understand:
- How attackers gather information using reconnaissance.  
- How defenders can detect and mitigate risks by analyzing open ports and services.  

The lab was created in a **VirtualBox environment**, ensuring a safe and isolated setup for ethical testing.

## üîπ 2. Methodology

### Step 1: Host Discovery
- **Tool Used:** Netdiscover  
- **Command:**  
  ```bash
  netdiscover -r 192.168.134.128/24

__ Result: Identified target IP 192.168.134.128 ___

Step 2: Ping Scan

Tool Used: Nmap

Command:

nmap -sn 192.168.134.128


Result: Confirmed that the host is alive.

Step 3: Full Port Scan

Tool Used: Nmap

Command:

nmap -p- 192.168.134.128


Result: Multiple open ports discovered (21, 22, 23, 25, 80, 3306, 5432 etc.).

Step 4: Service & Version Detection


Tool Used: Nmap

Command:

nmap -sV 192.168.134.128


Result:

FTP ‚Üí vsftpd 2.3.4

SSH ‚Üí OpenSSH 4.7p1

Apache HTTPD ‚Üí 2.2.8

MySQL ‚Üí 5.0.51a

Step 5: OS Fingerprinting

Tool Used: Nmap
Command:

nmap -O 192.168.134.128


Result: Detected OS: Linux KernelStep 6: Web Vulnerability Scan

Step 6: Web Vulnerability Scan

Tool Used: Nikto

Command:

nikto -h http://192.168.56.102


Result:

Outdated Apache server detected.

Possible XSS vulnerabilities.

Directory listing enabled.

3. Results & Findings
üîπ 3. Results & Findings

Target machine is running multiple outdated services.

Open ports (FTP, SSH, MySQL, PostgreSQL) could be exploited by attackers.

Apache web server has known vulnerabilities.

Lack of patching & misconfiguration make the system highly vulnerable.



üîπ 4. Conclusion

This project demonstrated how network scanning is the first step in cybersecurity investigations.

Attackers use these techniques to find weak points.

Defenders use them to identify and fix vulnerabilities before exploitation.

By performing this project, we gained practical knowledge of:

Reconnaissance & scanning using Nmap.

Web vulnerability analysis using Nikto.




Importance of proper documentation & evidence collection.
